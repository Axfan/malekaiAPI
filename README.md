# malekaiApi

An API for a game I'm making (or was).

Node.js, Express, RethinkDB, and Typescript, yahoo!

Feel free to learn.

## To setup:

Install node v6, start up a rethinkdb server with default ports/etc.

`npm install` the project.

## To run:

`npm start` or `tsc && node dist/server.js`, if you have `typescript` installed globally
