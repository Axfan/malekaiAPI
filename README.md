# malekaiApi

The api for the malekai project.

## To setup:

Install node v6, start up a rethinkdb server with default ports/etc.

`npm install` the project.

## To run:

`npm start` or `tsc && node dist/server.js`, if you have `typescript` installed globally.

Make sure to clear the dist folder if you want to remove old files (important for building
for release!).
